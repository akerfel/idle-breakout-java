# idle-breakout-java

A clone of a small subset of the game [idle breakout](https://kodiqi.itch.io/idle-breakout), originally created by kodiqi. Implemented using Java/Processing.

To ensure smooth collision detection, I applied techniques suggested on [this webpage](https://happycoding.io/tutorials/processing/collision-detection).
